 * --- Setting
 * 
 * A researcher has been assumed missing in Erwyn Bay while on a job cataloging the wildlife.
 * For a time, she actively sent back logs and data, but has not been heard back from in over
 * 72 hours, which is certainly not a good thing, especially for an independent assignment.
 * Her last tracked location was inside of an abandoned outpost's warehouse, which she likely
 * used as her basecamp before disappearing.
 * 
 * As a wildlife researcher from the same organization, you have been tasked with inspecting
 * the situation, as well as recovering valuable data from the researcher's computer.
 * 
 * --- History
 * 
 * Erwyn Bay is a place notorious for its strange and unexplained natural phenomena. Sitting
 * just short of the arctic, it is separated from a vast tundra just beyond its surrounding
 * mountain walls, open only to the coast. In addition to this, the region recieves a near
 * excessive amount of snow year-round, and is always cloaked with a thick fog.
 * 
 * It once served as an isolated supply outpost for a shipping company, which went bankrupt
 * several years ago. Some who had stayed there expressed a belief that the company's
 * downfall was a result of intruding on sacred northern lands, that there was some kind of
 * curse that affected the area, as well as those who dare tread near. They had also reported
 * sightings of people in the cliffs, despite their being no form of civilization for over a
 * hundred miles. Outside perspectives firmly believe that the former residents suffered from
 * hallucinations and psychological issues due to the weather and isolation.
